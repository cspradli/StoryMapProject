  <h4>The United States / Mexico border has become a political hotspot of controversy with the Trump Administration&#39s 
    tightening of border security and the oppositions fight to help migrants crossing the border. The border and the 
    land that encompasses it is an unwelcoming place fro migrants. Harsh terrain, extreme temperatures, and vicious 
    border patrol agents operating on zero-tolerance policy make crossing a perilous feat that leaves many dead in their efforts.

  <h2 style="font-style: italic; font-size: 1.0em;">Cabeza Prieta National Wildlife Refuge, Ariz. - Four aid workers 
    arrested while attempting to leave water for migrants crossing the border
  </h2>

  <h4>In 2018, federal prosecutors in Arizona charged four humanitarian aid workers who left water in the desert for 
      migrants who might otherwise suffer from exposure to the elements and thirst. In another case, the Washington Post reports that federal prosecutors dropped manslaughter charges against a border patrol agent who fired 16 times across the border, killing a Mexican boy. The aid workers face a fine and up to six months in jail. 
      <br><br>The crimes made by these aid workers: entering the Cabeza Prieta National Wildlife Refuge without permits 
      to leave supplies for migrants crossing into the United States. 
      <br><br>This is not the first time the U.S. government has come after activists, however the breadth of the 
      campaign against these workers, and the use of the Wilderness act which secured their charges of trespassing 
      was a first. In previous, people wandering around the refuge without proper documents might be sent off with a 
      warning. The Trump administration chose the more severe approach.

       aid and targeting care for folks who cross the border. &#34
      <br><br>These arrests show a glimpse into a larger problem of the United States Border Patrol&#39s attempt to curb 
      immigrants entering the United States. Rather than recognizing that U.S. demand was drawing migrants and crafting
